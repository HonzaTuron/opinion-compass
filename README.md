## Introduction and Features
The Opinion Compass is designed to analyze the opinions of individuals based on specified statements. Users can simply provide the name of the person whose opinions they want to analyze along with the specific opinion statement. 

Key functionalities:
- **AI Analysis:** Leverages AI technology to provide analysis on the provided opinions.
- **Evidence Consideration:** Includes various pieces of evidence that influence the final analysis, enhancing the comprehensiveness of the insights.

### Evidence Scoring

The Opinion Compass analyzes multiple pieces of evidence and provides detailed scoring:

Each piece of evidence is evaluated with two key metrics:
- **Opinion Score (-1.0 to 1.0)**: Indicates how strongly the evidence supports or opposes the opinion
  - 1.0: Strongly supports the opinion
  - 0.0: Neutral stance
  - -1.0: Strongly opposes the opinion
- **Relevance Score (0.0 to 1.0)**: Shows how relevant the evidence is to the opinion
  - 1.0: Highly relevant evidence
  - 0.0: Not relevant

Example output of single evidence data point:
```json
    {
        "source": "X/Twitter",
        "score": -0.8,
        "relevance": 1,
        "text": "This declaration is a sad testament of bad Brusselian leadership. While President @realDonaldTrump and President Putin negotiate on peace, EU officials issue worthless statements.\n\nYou canâ€™t request a seat at the negotiating table. You have to earn it! Through strength, good leadership and smart diplomacy.\n\nThe position of Brussels - to support killing as long as it takes - is morally and politically unacceptable.",
        "url": "https://x.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1889976335897899377"
    }
```

### Aggregated Score
The system produces a final aggregated score (-1.0 to 1.0) that considers all pieces of evidence, weighted by their relevance. This provides a comprehensive assessment of the person's stance on the given opinion.
